        "question": "How is Zeyn different from Microsoft Word or Google Docs?",
        "answer": "Unlike traditional word processors that are designed for documents, Zeyn is built specifically for novel writing. We focus on distraction-free writing with features like zen mode, chapter organization, progress tracking, and goal setting. You won't find unnecessary formatting options or business document features‚Äîjust the tools you need to write your story."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I import my existing manuscript from Word or other apps?",
        "answer": "Yes! Zeyn supports importing from Word (.docx), Google Docs, plain text (.txt), and Markdown (.md) files. Simply drag and drop your files or use the import function. The app will intelligently break your content into chapters if it detects chapter headings, or you can organize it manually after import."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data safe? What happens if I lose internet connection?",
        "answer": "Your data is automatically saved locally on your device every few seconds, so you never lose work even without internet. With a Professional or Team subscription, your projects are also continuously synced to the cloud with enterprise-grade encryption. We use the same security standards as banks, and you can export your data at any time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Zeyn offline?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Zeyn works completely offline. All your writing, editing, and organization features are available without an internet connection. Your work is saved locally, and when you reconnect, any cloud sync (if you have a paid plan) will automatically update your backup."
      },
      {
        "question": "What export formats are supported?",
        "answer": "All plans support PDF and Word (.docx) export. Professional and Team plans also include EPUB for ebook publishing, Markdown, HTML, and plain text. You can export individual chapters, selected scenes, or your entire manuscript with custom formatting options for different publishing requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a mobile app?",
        "answer": "Yes! Zeyn is available on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux. The web version works on any device with a modern browser. All versions sync seamlessly with your paid plan, so you can write on your laptop at home and continue on your phone during your commute."
